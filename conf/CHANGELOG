Version: 2.0
Date:    Jan 5, 2011

FrontView Add-on SDK 2.0 introduces a new update framework to add-ons.  The new framework
adds the ability for FrontView to detect if there's a new update for the add-on, get
info on the new update, and download and install the add-on.  In addition, progress of
the download and installation are displayed.

You will need RAIDiator 4.2.16 or above to utilize the new framework.  Any add-on created
with SDK 2.0 will still work with earlier RAIDiator releases, however new update
framework will not be exposed.  Similarly, add-ons created with pre-SDK 2.0 will still
show up in 4.2.16 but will not have the update option.
